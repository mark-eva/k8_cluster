
1. Configure kubernetes cluster
2. Research the best aws archivecture with regards to K8 and build terraform form code against that
3. Research about best naming convention for your terraform code


Configure kubernetes cluster
    - Add the manual process you have to ansible
    - Create a role/playbook for adding a node in the cluster 





# create a playbook that adds nodes into the k8 cluster

After initiation period:
    - capture the syntax required for the node addition
    - use this syntax and apply it in all  worker nodes within the cluster

Scaling up
    - Check the output of token list to see if its still valid
        not:
            - generate a new syntax for adding a new node
        valid:
            - generate a syntax utilising the existing details
